# PiCounter
## Frequency counter for experimental physics using the Raspberry Pi

### Overview
This repository holds schematics and information for the PiCounter, a firmwareless and fairly simple device for accurately measuring
the frequency of an electrical signal using the Raspberry Pi to control data collection. The device has the following features:
- Maximum count rate of up to 40 MHz
- 32-bit count capacity
- Two channels
- AND/OR coincidence mode for cosmic ray detection and similar applications
- Low total cost of manufacture
- Highly stable and accurate quartz-based counting gate timer
- 1/256-second counting time resolution
- Support for arbitrarily long counting times
- Side-mounted serial interface breakout for easy attachment of debug cables
- Support for external clock input
